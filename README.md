# Hello_World
A practice environment for me to get comfortable with coding. 
Hello
I am a new developer that is practicing understanding the environments I will work with.
I want to be good enough to do at least something semi-complex on my own.
Honestly I would be amazed if I could make a tetris JavaScript application.
That may be my first real test/project for myself.
I have been in school doing computer and web programming for the last 5 years.
Recently I have been studying Game Development. 
I would love to one day end up programming some games.
I just want to feel like I am doing something worthwhile.
I am also pretty bad at keyboarding.
